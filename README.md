# Rock, Paper Scissors Game - Hobby Project

This was a small personal project and deployment I made to practise using React components, state, props, passing state and props between components, rules matrixes and conditional rendering.
The base of this project was Vite.

I also decided to deploy this site to Render.com. It can be accessed here: https://rockpaperscissors-tt4y.onrender.com/
(Warning: It might take a while to load as Render spin down hosted web pages when not in use so it has to spin up first!)
