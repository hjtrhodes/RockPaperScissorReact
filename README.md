## Project Description
This is a small project I created when first learning React to practise using components, managing and passing state and functions as props, conditional rendering, rules matrixes and later, my first deployment.

## Functionality:
- Conditional Rendering based on name state
- Rules matrix containing possible outcomes of rock, paper, scissors game
- Conditional rendering of win/loss/draw
- Using state to display user entered name
- Simple component design

## Challenges
State/Conditional Rendering:
- This was my first attempt at conditional rendering and what seems easy now, seemed hard then. It took me a while to understand how managing the name state of the user could be used to conditionally render the game itself. I got passed this by researching and trial and erroring my way to some new knowledge.
